Hi, it is nice see you here! 

This repo just contains my curriculum in LaTeX, a great, interesting mathematical text format language (also here you will find the latex compiled in pdf). 

But, my curriculum in pdf is more nice to see into my personal website [suelengc.com](http://suelengc.com). I hope to see you there! ;)

Bye!
